Release Description 4.0.0

  This release of the Middleware Program Set is a component of the integrated release ({{{../../cm/release/index-4.0.0.html}4.0.0}}) of the PO.DAAC System. 
  
  The Middleware Program Set is new to the PO.DAAC System.  This program is defined to group all middleware-related modules for the PO.DAAC System.  In the ({{{../../cm/release/index-4.0.0.html}4.0.0}}) of PO.DAAC System, a middleware components was released as part of the Ingest Program Set, the ingest-grails module.  Our success in the application of middleware technology into the PO.DAAC System has demonstrated the need of more web-enable service components in the future of PO.DAAC.  
  
  The first module being released with this program set is the Manager module.  The Manager module is the successor of the ingest-grails module.  Building on capabilities delivered in the last release, this release focuses on improving the overall reliability of the Middleware Services used by the PO.DAAC System.  The service architecture offers simplified and flexible approach for organizing data products from various mission and/or instruments. 
  
  The second module being released with this program set is the Inventory Web Service module. This module wraps the Inventory program set with a restful web service. This allows the Inventory program set to be separated from other modules, which increases security (fewer connections, usernames to the datbase) as well as flexibility (single point of Inventory changes, federate the inventory service). 3.2.1 is the initial release of the Inventory web service.
  
  Details on this release can be found in the following sections of this document:

{Liens}

  This section details the liens against the capabilities that have yet to be implemented or are partially implemented. In lieu of listing the liens by requirement they have been summarized. For a complete list of the requirements and their support status, see {{{Appendix A - Requirements Support}Appendix A}}.
  
  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/596}Ticket 596}} - Being able to reorder event grids in copied tabs on the Sigevent UI.

[]

  * Secondary Failover

  Running more than one instance of Manager, as specified in <L3.270> has not been tested yet.

  * Request Transmission/Retransmission

  Neither of the capabilities specified by <L3.293> nor <L3.294> have been implemented.

  * L3.170

  Two of the elements listed in this requirement have been interpreted differently from the original intention. They are:

    * e. Status of granule push (optional)

      Instead of having a separate status value for each granule, a status value has been assigned for each ingested package which may contain one or more granules. If one granule fails, the whole package will be rejected. Suggest removing this element from the requirement.

    * f. Transfer time of granule to external destination host (optional)

      Instead of tracking the time to transfer to the destination host, this element will track the time to transfer from the source host. Suggest rewording this element.

  A request will be made to the System Engineer to reword this requirement.

{System Requirements}

  The software contained in this program set was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically developed under Sun Java version 1.5 and has only been tested with this version.

  * PO.DAAC Standard Computing Environment

  This will eventually be documented on the Wiki and linked to in future releases. For now, the following software and tools should be available in the current environment:

    * Apache Ant 1.7.X

    * Apache Maven 2.2.1
    
    * JBoss 5.1.0.GA

    * SFTP/FTP Client/Server

    []

    See the system-level {{{../../cm/release/index-1.4.1.html}release}} document for specific version numbers.

  * JBoss Application Server

  The Middleware Set requires an instance of the JBoss Application Server to be installed, configured for PO.DAAC and running in the current environment. In order to satisfy this requirement, the administrator should following the procedure detailed in the {{{../jboss/index.html}JBoss Application Server}} document.

  For this release, it is not necessary to reinstall or reconfigure the JBoss Application Server.

{Installation}

  This section details the procedures for installing and configuring the software in this program set.

* Manager Installation

  The Manager module consists of the RESTful interface to the PO.DAAC data acquisition and archive service. The installation of this module is covered in the {{{../manager/install/index.html}Manager Installation}} document.

{Operation}

* Manager Operation

  The operation of this module is covered in the {{{../manager/operate/index.html}Manager Operation}} document.

{Appendix B - Test Status}

* Program Set Tests

  The following test scenarios were performed prior to deployment using various test data inputs.

** Testing reliable submission

  * Start JBoss with Manager deployed.
  
  * Start Ingest daemons and Archive daemons that registers to the Manager.
  
  * Verify the engine instance has been registered and it is active - according to the Manager
  
+--
  SELECT ing_engine.active, ing_engine.is_online
  FROM ing_federation, ing_engine
  WHERE ing_federation.name='<federation name>'
     AND ing_engine.name='<engine name>'
+--
  
  * Run <<<ingest add>>> from the Ingest Program Set to submit a new product (granule).

  * Verification by query in the Ingest ing_product table
  
+--  
  SELECT ing_product.* 
  FROM ing_product, ing_product_type 
  WHERE ing_product_type.name='<product type>' 
     AND ing_product.name='<granule name>'
+--

  * Use the query above to monitor the 'current_state' and 'current_lock' for the product.
  
  * When the granule's state is in 'INVENTORIED', or 'PENDING_ARCHIVE', or 'ARCHIVED', the query above also returns an 'inventory_id'.  That is the Granule id within the inventory.

  * Verify inventory data.  Use the following example queries below to verify the inventory granule data

+--
SELECT 
    GRANULE_ID, 
    DATASET_ID, 
    NAME, 
    START_TIME, 
    STOP_TIME, 
    INGEST_TIME, 
    CREATE_TIME, 
    VERSION, 
    ACCESS_TYPE, 
    STATUS 
FROM 
    GRANULE
WHERE
    GRANULE_ID=<inventory_id>;
+--
