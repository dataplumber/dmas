{Capabilities}

  This section details the new, modified and corrected capabilities that comprise this release of the Archive Program Set. In lieu of listing the capabilities by requirement they have been summarized. For a complete list of the requirements and their support status, see {{{Appendix_A_-_Requirements_Support}Appendix A}}.

* New Capabilities

* {{{https://podaac-redmine.jpl.nasa.gov/issues/1738}1738}} - Merge from 3.4 - Archive - Generate granule status change logs

* {{{https://podaac-redmine.jpl.nasa.gov/issues/1792}1792}} - Merge from 3.4 - Archive - Archive report of 24 hrs activity logs span does not match EMS report

* {{{https://podaac-redmine.jpl.nasa.gov/issues/1852}1852}} - Merge from 3.4 - Archive - Rolling store can only roll off granules that have a remote base location policy

{Liens}

  This section details the liens against the capabilities that have yet to be implemented or are partially implemented. In lieu of listing the liens by requirement they have been summarized. For a complete list of the requirements and their support status, see {{{Appendix_A_-_Requirements_Support}Appendix A}}.

  * Support for Post-Processing

    There is a requirement for certain datasets that once the associated granule file is placed in the archive, it should be compressed in place. If done appropriately, this will also impact the metadata associated with that granule.

  * Documentation and Software

    Still need to address the management of documentation and software in the archive as specified by <L3.201>.

  * Scalability

    Still need to address how the design supports the scalability capability specified by <L3.292>.

  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/173}CR-173}} - handle ^C and send info to the log for verifier.sh

{System Requirements}

  The software contained in this program set was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically developed under Sun Java version 1.5 and has only been tested with this version.

  * PO.DAAC Standard Computing Environment

  This will eventually be documented on the Wiki and linked to in future releases. For now, the following software and tools should be available in the current environment:

    * Apache Maven 2.0.X

    * Perl 5.X

    * Subversion Client 1.3.X

    * Sun Java Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.6.0_19

    []

    See the system-level {{{../../cm/release/index-4.2.1.html}release}} document for specific version numbers.

{Compilation}

  This section details the procedures for setting up and building the software in this program set. Compilation is covered in a separate {{{../compile/index.html}Compilation}} document.

{Installation}

  This section details the procedures for installing and configuring the software in this program set. Installation is covered in a separate {{{../install/index.html}Installation}} document.

{Operation}

  This section details any necessary setup and the commands for running the applications in this program set. Operation is covered in a separate {{{../operate/index.html}Operation}} document.

{Appendix A - Requirements Support}

  The capabilities in this release are detailed in the table below based on the requirements specified in the {{{https://bravo-lib.jpl.nasa.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-279402/PO.DAAC_Reqs_20070726.xls}PO.DAAC User and System Requirements}} document. The allocation of the Level 3 system requirements to the program sets is captured in the {{{https://bravo-lib.jpl.nasa.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Version-548802/podaac_req_alloc_20080427.xls}Level 3 Requirements Allocation}} document. The values for the Support column are defined as follows:

  * <<Full>> - The capability specified by the associated requirement has been implemented and tested at the program set level.

  * <<Partial>> - The capability has been partially implemented. The content of the Description column should provide more details.

  * <<No>> - The capability has not yet been implemented.

{Appendix B - Test Status}

  This appendix details tests and test procedures for unit and program set level testing performed prior to integration and test by the development staff.

* Unit Tests

  The results of unit testing prior to deployment can be found in the {{{../surefire-report.html}Maven Surefire Report}}. Descriptions of the unit tests can be found in the {{{../testapidocs/index.html}Test JavaDocs}}.

  <<Note:>> The unit tests were disabled at the time of this site's deployment due to environmental dependencies. This will be addressed in the next release.

* Program Set Tests

  The following specific test cases have been executed on this release:

  * A test AIP containing 1000 granules.
  
  * A test AIP containing a granule with an associated data file that was 230 megabytes in size.
  
  * A batch of 1000 test AIPs containing a single granule each.
